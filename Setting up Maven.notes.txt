Download Mongo DB and install.

As course suggests we have used Maven
Maven is a build automation tool

Download Maven
Extract
Set M2_HOME and MAVEN_HOME to base directory 
(currently M2_HOME is used but some programs may use MAVEN_HOME, so better set both)
Add bin folder to path

Check Maven, run 
mvn -version

To use in IntelliJ Idea
you can creat new maven project. 
Or can import already created project
Or add framework support to existing project
