I assume you have alreay done the MongoDb setup
Also assuming you are using Maven
open Pom.xml

Add new XML node 'dependencies' if does not exists
Add new child node 'dependency'

Add details as follows: 

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
            <artifactId>mongo-java-driver</artifactId>
            <version>2.10.1</version>
        </dependency>
		
groupId, artifactId and version details are filled by IntelliSense.

Now Maven will do rest of things for you.
Your project is set up for using MongoDb.
